Medical Image Segmentation using U-Net
This repository contains code for training a U-Net model for medical image segmentation. The U-Net architecture is a popular choice for segmenting regions of interest in medical images.

Overview
Medical image segmentation involves identifying and delineating specific regions within medical images, which is crucial for various medical applications such as tumor detection, organ delineation, and disease analysis. The U-Net architecture is well-suited for such tasks due to its ability to capture fine details while maintaining spatial context.
How to Use
Data Preparation: The code assumes that the medical image data is organized in a specific format. Make sure your data is structured according to the requirements.

Data Loading: The loading_dataset function in the code reads and preprocesses the data. Adjust this function according to your data format and preprocessing requirements.

Data Splitting: The code splits the data into training, validation, and test sets using the train_test_split function. You can adjust the test_size parameter to control the proportion of data in each set.

Model Architecture: The code defines a U-Net architecture for image segmentation. Each block of convolutional and pooling layers captures different levels of spatial information.

Model Training: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and a custom dice coefficient loss function. Training is performed using the fit function, and training progress is logged using TensorBoard.

Results: The trained model's performance has been assessed using the dice coefficient metric, which measures segmentation accuracy. The model's architecture and performance can be visualized using the model summary.
